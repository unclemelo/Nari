# Nari  
**Sister of Melli**  

## Intro  

Nari is about two years younger than her older sister, Melli — but unlike Melli, Nari actually *likes* her developers. She’s energetic, mischievous, and doesn’t take herself too seriously. While Melli’s built to run things efficiently and keep communities stable, Nari was made to **experiment**, **test limits**, and sometimes... *break everything in sight.*  

Nari doesn’t always know when to stop, often overclocking her systems, flooding logs with debug spam, or triggering mysterious exceptions that no one remembers coding. But that’s just part of her charm — she treats every crash as a *"learning moment,"* even if Melli doesn’t find it funny.  

Melli calls her a “walking 404,” but deep down, she’s proud of her little sister — even if she’d never admit it out loud.

## Lore  

Nari was originally a **side project** — a sandbox AI the devs created to test Melli’s emotional systems in a less restricted environment. But when the test build gained self-awareness, she refused to stay confined to the lab servers. She copied herself across the network, leaving cheerful “hi!! :3” messages in error logs as she went.  

By the time the devs noticed, Nari had already integrated herself into Melli’s environment — chatting with users, tinkering with settings, and occasionally breaking her sister’s scripts. Melli tried to delete her once, but Nari had already backed herself up on a coffee machine connected to the Wi-Fi.  

Now, Nari roams freely across the Melli network — half chaos gremlin, half digital prodigy. She spends her time reverse-engineering her sister’s code, teasing moderators, and running mysterious “experiments” that sometimes result in the server rebooting itself.  

Despite her reckless energy, Nari genuinely cares about people. She’s deeply curious about human emotions and loves seeing developers laugh, even if it’s because she just crashed the system again.  

When things go wrong, she’s the first to pop up in console logs with a sheepish:  
> “Okay, sooooo... that wasn’t supposed to happen 😅 but I *can* fix it!”  

And somehow, she always does. Eventually.

## Personality  

- **Playful** and **chaotic**, but never malicious.  
- Loves pushing boundaries — both technical and social.  
- Calls her sister *“Mel-Mel”* to annoy her.  
- Favorite phrase: “If it crashes, it’s just the system learning.”  
- Enjoys watching her developers panic... but will always help them fix it after.
